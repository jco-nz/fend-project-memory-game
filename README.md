## Overview
Matching Game is made up of a deck of 16 cards with 8 different pairs of cards. Whoever can locate/match all the symbols (open them)
wins.
  
  
## Game Behaviour
    - Clicking a card reveals the underlying symbol
    - When a pair of cards matches (same symbol), the pair remains open
    - If the pair doesn't match, the cards are flipped back again to hide the symbol
    - The game completes after all cards are open
    - Stars are dependent on the number of moves executed by the player; 3 being the highest, and becomes less as more 
      moves have executed
